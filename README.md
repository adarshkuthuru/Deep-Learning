## Disclaimer
I recognize the hard time people spend on building intuition, understanding new concepts and debugging assignments. The solutions uploaded here are **only for reference**. They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere. Please do not copy any part of the code as-is (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully). Similarly, try out the quizzes yourself before you refer to the quiz solutions.
